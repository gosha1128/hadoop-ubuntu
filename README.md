# hadoop-ubuntu

Getting hadoop up and running from scratch is not a trivial task.  Here's how I did it - and hopefully these instructions will help you out if you are doing something similar !

## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu Desktop 14.04

## Hadoop 2.6.0

Download the 2.6.0 hadoop tar ball and unpack it

```
wget http://mirror.symnds.com/software/Apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
gunzip hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
tar xvf hadoop-2.6.0.tar
```

Move the directory

```
sudo mv hadoop-2.6.0/ /usr/local
cd /usr/local
sudo ln -s hadoop-2.6.0/ hadoop
```
