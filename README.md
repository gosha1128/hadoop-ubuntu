# hadoop-ubuntu

Getting hadoop up and running from scratch is not a trivial task.  Here's how I did it - and hopefully these instructions will help you out if you are doing something similar !

## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu Desktiop 14.04

## Hadoop

Download the 2.6.0 hadoop tar ball

```
wget http://mirror.symnds.com/software/Apache/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.6.0/hadoop-2.6.0.tar.gz
```
